tapACat
=======
tapACat is my first iPhone app! It is a project I decided to do to help me learn how to use the Apple frameworks and the 
Swift language. tapACat is a simple game where cats will appear in random squares on the screen and the user will have to 
"tap the cat" before the cat button disappears. The more cats that the user taps will cause the cat to appear for less and 
less time. That is basically the game. It also has a highScore board and a help screen. This is my first app so any help or 
criticism is welcome.
